Based on the codebase analysis, I can confirm that the implementation matches the description provided. 
Here's a detailed breakdown of the key components and their functionality:

Voice Chat System (ElevenLabs Integration):
The GigiConversation component handles the ElevenLabs widget integration
Uses a 5-minute trial system tracked in the voice_chat_usage table
Trial status is managed through the check_trial_eligibility Supabase function
Widget initialization is handled with proper cleanup and error handling

Text Chat System:
Implemented in the Chat and SpotlightChat components
New users get 50 free messages (tracked in user_balances table)
Real-time balance updates through Supabase subscriptions
UserBalance component shows remaining credits

Subscription System:
Uses Stripe for payment processing
Webhook handler (/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts) manages:
checkout.session.completed
invoice.paid
invoice.payment_failed
Subscription status tracked in user_subscriptions table
Real-time subscription updates through Supabase channels

Authentication Flow:
Handles user signup/login
Initializes user profile and balance (50 free messages)
Sets up subscription tracking
Manages trial eligibility
The implementation provides a robust system for handling both voice and text chat features, with separate trial/subscription mechanisms for each. The code includes proper error handling, real-time updates, and a clean separation of concerns between components.
Would you like me to dive deeper into any particular aspect of the implementation?
